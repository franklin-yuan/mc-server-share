Instructions on how to run a Crazy Craft Updated Server:

1. Run the "start.bat" file and wait till it closes itself
2. Agree to the Mincecraft Eula in "eula.txt" by changing the "false" to "true"
3. Rerun the "start.bat" file and let the server generate (If it gets stuck at any point for longer than 4 min, Re-Run the File.)
4. You can now run the server whenever you would like.

To check if the server is running, in your Crazy Craft Updated Modpack Launch, use "localhost" as an IP address to connect to the server
